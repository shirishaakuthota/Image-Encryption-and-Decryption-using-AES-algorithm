This project addresses the need for robust image encryption and decryption mechanisms by implementing a dual-layer security approach. By combining visual cryptography and the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), this system provides a comprehensive solution that ensures the confidentiality and integrity of image data.
Product Features

Image Encryption: Encrypt images using AES combined with visual cryptography.

Image Decryption: Decrypt images using the secret key and the generated visual shares.

Secure Storage: Encrypted images are stored securely, ensuring data privacy.

Cross-Platform: Compatible with Windows, Linux, and MacOS.

Python 3.11 or above

Libraries: Pillow, NumPy, PyCryptodome, Tkinter
